        "Using my code, I have found that the mean of all my testing values is approximately .80 and the standard deviation is approximately .07. The mean of the training r squared value is approximately .81 and the standard deviation is approximately .01. This means that the r squared values for the training model is more reliable than the testing value, which is expected because we used the training data to train the model; however, the standard deviation for the testing data shows that the cross-validation model is still relatively reliable for the testing data. Therefore, I can conclude that my model can consistently use the duration of an eruption to predict the waiting time for the next eruption."
